# RoboRelief

This application is Android OS based application.This application uses IBM Watson for configuring the chatbot.

We want our project RoboRelief to work as an emotional resilient tool for mental health. People can talk 
to “Reliefo” the bot in RoboRelief when they do not want to talk to another human being. We want to 
help people who are in stress and are in tension. Our aim is that Reliefo helps people to reflect and learn 
more about themselves, their own well-being and the things they can do to strengthen their well-being. 
Initially, we want this chat based function to allow the users to be more reflective. It is quite safe and 
secure because this is anonymous as it is just the friend of the person, who has RoboRelief in his or her 
 phone. We want to make the world more mentally resilient. Technology has always been seen as a part 
of the problem, an introducer, an enhancer of the problems and now we want to make it the solution.
